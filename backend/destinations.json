Animal sacrifices, particularly of cockerels and uncastrated male goats, are the main way that the goddess is worshipped, and this is especially seen during the Dashain festival. Dakshin Kali Temple has also the same religious value as Pashupatinath Temple and Manakamana Temple in Nepal. The temple has more tourist attractions as it is a popular hiking destination located near Pharping village in Nepal. Mother Dakshinakali is the most popular form of Kali. She is the benevolent mother, who protects her devotees and children from mishaps and misfortunes.it usually closes at 11.30 Am for rituals and open at next day.",
